## About

A notebook called draft something for some days or forever. A notebook is also known as a notepad, writing pad, drawing pad.
We can say another way what is notebook “A notebook (also known as Notepad, writing pad, drawing pad, or legal Notepad) is a book or a stack of pages.
usually used for note-taking or memo, other writing, drawing, or scrapbook purposes”.Now a day’s Notepad is essential for everyone.
We cannot do without it. Every day anyone needs to keep in password, E-mail, Id, phone number, Name anytime.
From my earlier, I wished to research software, programming, android related field. But all the supervisor was booked by others students.
But my passion for coding, I request to be my supervisor to Fu Youjia he has accepted me. Very thanks to my tutor Fu Youjia finally supervised me.
Otherwise, maybe I couldn’t research android programming. I want to explore a notepad that is an essential tool for everybody how can develop it.
Perhaps many people have noted something but lost it any time; this is significantly soreness. Here may have necessary note but lost it is very harmful.
I develop an android notepad app by thinking about the people who are lost their draft. 

Here I have developed an Internet Notepad(working) based on android.
This was the first time for me to make an android application. I started it in the first week of March, but June first is still abode by it.
Some time I faced a terrible bug when I wanted to give up. But the attempt makes me successful today.
Believing one thing is taking me here that “everything is possible in the real World for continuous attempting” without this passion, that is the abortive attempt.
Finally, I have successfully done it. I plan to upload the app to the google play store after some days.
The first version is simple, but the next upgraded version will be developed with more extra features.
